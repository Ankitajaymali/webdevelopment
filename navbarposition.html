<h3> First product in the nivea list is none other than our good old Nivea Creme. I am sure most of you must have used it at some point in your life. The cream comes in its signature blue colored tin form & has the typical Nivea fragrance. The consistency is thick & creamy and can be used by all skin types. It moisturizes really well & keeps dryness at bay. However, since it tends to leave a greasy film behind, not everybody would like to use it as face cream.

    But it can very well be applied on other dry areas such as heels, knees & elbows. Must have for dry skin. The nivea cream is easily available and affordable too! Price: Rs 200 for 200 ml

    <h2>The nivea face wash comes in a pretty blue colored tube packaging and is best suited for normal skin. The face wash has a gel-like consistency and easily spreads on the face. It cleanses wonderfully & makes the face perfectly clean. It keeps dirt, grime & oil at bay and refreshes the skin. And, the mild pleasant fragrance is just amazing! Price: Rs 165 for 150 ml</h3>

        <p>This is one of my personal favorites & is ideal for hot summer months. The formula is enriched with Sea Minerals & Hydra IQ and is best suited for normal skin. Consistency of the body lotion is smooth & slightly on the runny side and spreads on the skin with ease. Being lightweight, it vanishes into the skin beautifully without being greasy at all. Nivea lotion makes the skin silky smooth and keeps it hydrated for a good 6 plus hours. The fragrance is also mild and would not bother sensitive noses. One of the best nivea products in Indian market. A must try! Price: Rs 180 for 200 ml

            It keeps you fresh throughout the day with its lovely, subtle and refreshing fragrance, keeping the body odor away. Sprinkle all over your body to get that fresh feeling and to get that smooth and silky skin. ... Alternatively, you can also find many more products from the Nivea Pure Talc range.</h1></font>
            The nivea lip balms easily glide on the lips & impart a slight glossy sheen. Most of these nivea lip balms are well pigmented and add a healthy flush of color to the lips. They keep the lips hydrated for 3-4 hours, after which they need to be reapplied. As the name suggests, these have a fruity fragrance and are easy on the pocket as well. Almost all the lip balm shades have their detailed reviews and swatches on VNA which you can check via search bar. Price: Rs 175 for 4.8 gm
